# Hypothesis testing ( one mean )

In statistics a hypothesis is a claim about a population parameter

**null hypothesis / alternative hypothesis**

Every hypothosis begins with two hypothesis the null and the alternative

    assume we are in a courtroom
    the null hypothesis is that a defendent is innocent
    the alternative is guilty

null = default

alternative = anything else

## testing claims about population proportion


Example Android devices had 87% of the market share for smartphones in 2019. In a random
sample of 1000 smartphone users in March 2020, 895 used Android devices. At a significance
level of 5%, test the claim that Android‚Äôs market share stayed the same from 2019 to 2020

1. hypothesis

    the population parameter is $p_H$
    - $P = 87\% $
    - $P \neq 87\% $

    the hypotheses are
    - $H_0 = P = 87\%$
    - $H_1 = P \neq 87\%$

2. test statistic

    $z= \frac{\hat{p}-p}{\sqrt \frac {p(1-p)}{n}}$

    $ \frac {0.895 - 0.87} {0.010635} = 2.35$


3. critical value

    $\alpha / 2 = $ critical z value

    $ 0.05/2 = 0.025$

    $ 1-0.025 = 0.975 =$ z-value

    z value $0.975 = Z 1.96$
    
     $Z_{crit} = \pm 1.96$

     Rejection region is $ {1.96} \leq  z \geq 1.96$

4. conclusion

as our data reflects a z of 2.35 which is larger than the critical value we can **reject** the hypothesis

## claims about $\mu$ with $\alpha$ unknown


Example Assume that the amount of time it takes to send a 10 Mb file across a network is
normally distributed. To test the claim that the mean length of time to transfer a 10 Mb file
across a network is 12.44 seconds, you send a 10 Mb file across a network at 20 random times,
finding a mean of 13.71 seconds and a standard deviation of 2.65 seconds. Use ùõº = 0.05.

1. hypothesis

    the population parameter CLAIM is $\mu = 12.44$

    the hypotheses are
    - $H_0 = \mu =12.44$
    - $H_1 - \mu \neq 12.44$

2. test statistic

    $t_{stat} = \frac {\bar {x} - \mu}{S/\sqrt n}$

    $\frac {13.71 -12.44}{2.65 / \sqrt 20}$

    $ t_{stat}\pm 2.143$

3. critical value

    we use the t table here
    calculate our df (degrees of freedom)

    $ df = n - 1$
    $ 20 -1 = 19$

    find 19 on left side of t-table

   for measuring only for increase or decrease we can look for just the $\alpha$
   but in this case we are looking at both increase and decrease so our calculation requires a two tailed graph or the equation
   
   $\alpha / 2 = $ cumulative probability

   $ df = 19$
   $cumprob = 0.025$
  
    $t_{crit} = 2.093$
4. conclusion

$t_{crit} - t_{stat} = \pm$
$2.093 - 2.143 = -0.05$
-0.05 is a negative so

**reject**

### Determining the Test Statistic and Checking the Requirements

**two types for this unit**

##### population proportion

$Z_{stat} = \frac {\hat{p}-p}{\sqrt \frac {p(1-p)}{n}}$

    $\hat{p}$ sample proportion take from an observed sample
    $p$ population proportion- hypothesized proportion in the population
    $n$ sample size

**population mean**

$t_{stat}= \frac {\bar{X}-\mu}{\frac{s}{\sqrt n}}$

    $\hat{X}$ Sample mean
    $\mu$ population mean
    $s$ sample standard deviation
    $n$ sample size

### Z stat assumption

**To assume the Z statistics are normal the following must all be true**
- the sample must be a simple random sample
- $X_1,X_2,X_3....,X_n$ are n copies of independent and identical bernoulli(p) random variable with $np \geq 5$ and $nq \geq 5$
- when there are samples from two populations the above must hold true for both

**To assume that the t-statistic really follows a t-distribution the following must all be true**
- the sample must be simple random sample
- either the original variable X is normal or $n \geq 30$
- when there are samples from two populations the above must be true for both

### Determining the Critical Value and Sketching the Rejection Region

|english|symbolic|null and alternative|tail region|
|--|--|--|--|
|less than 30% of canadians approve of stronger gun laws|$p<30\%$|$\frac {H_0 p \geq 0.3}{H_1 p \gt 0.3}$| right tailed ($H_1$ is checking to see if it is greater than $H_0$) |
|the mean age of the full time student is 22|$\mu = 22$|$\frac {H_0 p eq 22}{H_1 p \neq 22}$|right and left tails (compares vs greater and less that 22)|
|the mean age of the part time students is atleast 31 | $\mu \geq 31$ |$\frac {H_0 p \geq 31}{H_1 p \lt 31}$|left tailed (anything less than 31 is the alternative hypothosis $H_1$) |
|the mean clay content of building site a is greater than building site b|$\mu \geq 31$|$\frac {H_0 \mu _{A} - \mu _{B} \gt 0}{H_1  \mu _{A} - \mu _{B} \lt 0}$|right tailed (our $H_0$ or null hypothesis is wrong if site b has a **greater** clay content|

$\alpha$ or our significance level determines our shaded area for a rejection region

### writing our final conclusion

the conclusion of a hypothesis must be stated in terms of the original claim the wording depends on
- is the claim the null or alternative hypothesis
- was the null rejected or not

**for null hypotheses claims**

|Decision|reject null|fail to reject null|
|--|--|--|
|Wording|"there is sufficient evidence to reject the claim that.."|"There is insufficient evidence to reject the claim that..."|

**for alternative hypotheses claims**

|Decision|reject null|fail to reject null|
|--|--|--|
|Wording|"there is insufficient evidence to reject the claim that.."|"There is sufficient evidence to reject the claim that..."


### type 1 and type 2 error

ùêª0: The defendant is innocent

ùêª1: The defendant is guilty

we have 4 possible outcomes
1. guilty defendant found guilt 
    - no error
2. guilty defendant found innocent
    - type 2 error wrongly released
3. innocent defendant found innocent
    - no error
4. innocent defendant found guilty
    - Type 1 error wrongly convicted

**type 1 error**
can only occur if the null hypothesis is true. if the sample data leads us to reject $H_0$ even the $H_0$ is true we have commited a type 1 error

the probability for a type 1 error is equivilant to the significance level aka $\alpha$

to reduce type 1 errors either reduce $\alpha$ or the sample size $n$

**type 2 error**
 A Type 2 error can only occur if the null hypothesis ùêª0 is false. If the same data leads us
to fail to reject ùëØùüé even though ùëØùüé is false, then we have committed a Type 2 error.

the probability of this happening is called $\beta$

the formula for $\beta$ is $\beta$ = P(Fail to reject $H_0$ | $H_0$ is False)

resulting sample average is 64.5 cm and sample standard deviation is 2.5 cm. Suppose that the population of the
