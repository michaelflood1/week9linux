# Hypothesis testing ( one mean )

In statistics a hypothesis is a claim about a population parameter

**null hypothesis / alternative hypothesis**

Every hypothosis begins with two hypothesis the null and the alternative

    assume we are in a courtroom
    the null hypothesis is that a defendent is innocent
    the alternative is guilty

null = default

alternative = anything else

## testing claims about population proportion


Example Android devices had 87% of the market share for smartphones in 2019. In a random
sample of 1000 smartphone users in March 2020, 895 used Android devices. At a significance
level of 5%, test the claim that Android‚Äôs market share stayed the same from 2019 to 2020

1. hypothesis

    the population parameter is $p_H$
    - $P = 87\% $
    - $P \neq 87\% $

    the hypotheses are
    - $H_0 = P = 87\%$
    - $H_1 = P \neq 87\%$

2. test statistic

    $z= \frac{\hat {p}-p}{\sqrt \frac {p(1-p)}{n}}$

    $ \frac {0.895 - 0.87} {0.010635} = 2.35$


3. critical value

    $\alpha / 2 = $ critical z value

    $ 0.05/2 = 0.025$

    $ 1-0.025 = 0.975 =$ z-value

    z value $0.975 = Z 1.96$
    
     $Z_{crit} = \pm 1.96$

     Rejection region is $ {1.96} \leq  z \geq 1.96$

4. conclusion

as our data reflects a z of 2.35 which is larger than the critical value we can **reject** the hypothesis

## claims about $\mu$ with $\alpha$ unknown


Example Assume that the amount of time it takes to send a 10 Mb file across a network is
normally distributed. To test the claim that the mean length of time to transfer a 10 Mb file
across a network is 12.44 seconds, you send a 10 Mb file across a network at 20 random times,
finding a mean of 13.71 seconds and a standard deviation of 2.65 seconds. Use ùõº = 0.05.

1. hypothesis

    the population parameter CLAIM is $\mu = 12.44$

    the hypotheses are
    - $H_0 = \mu =12.44$
    - $H_1 - \mu \neq 12.44$

2. test statistic

    $t_{stat} = \frac {\bar {x} - \mu}{S/\sqrt n}$

    $\frac {13.71 -12.44}{2.65 / \sqrt 20}$

    $ t_{stat}\pm 2.143$

3. critical value

    we use the t table here
    calculate our df (degrees of freedom)

    $ df = n - 1$
    $ 20 -1 = 19$

    find 19 on left side of t-table

   for measuring only for increase or decrease we can look for just the $\alpha$
   but in this case we are looking at both increase and decrease so our calculation requires a two tailed graph or the equation
   
   $\alpha / 2 = $ cumulative probability

   $ df = 19$
   $cumprob = 0.025$
  
    $t_{crit} = 2.093$
4. conclusion

$t_{crit} - t_{stat} = \pm$
$2.093 - 2.143 = -0.05$
-0.05 is a negative so

**reject**

**the average students age is 22** mentions EQUAL

### if the claim does not involve equality than the claim becomes the alternative hypothesis $\neq \lt \gt$
**less than 30% of canadians approve of stronger gun laws** mentions LESS THAN ( inequal )

### Determining the Test Statistic and Checking the Requirements

**two types for this unit**

##### population proportion

$Z_{stat} = \frac {\hat{p}-p}{\sqrt \frac {p(1-p)}{n}}$

    $\hat{p}$ sample proportion take from an observed sample
    $p$ population proportion- hypothesized proportion in the population
    $n$ sample size

**population mean**

$t_{stat}= \frac {\bar{X}-\mu}{\frac{s}{\sqrt n}}$

    $\hat{X}$ Sample mean
    $\mu$ population mean
    $s$ sample standard deviation
    $n$ sample size

### Z stat assumption

**To assume the Z statistics are normal the following must all be true**
- the sample must be a simple random sample
- $X_1,X_2,X_3....,X_n$ are n copies of independent and identical bernoulli(p) random variable with $np \geq 5$ and $nq \geq 5$
- when there are samples from two populations the above must hold true for both

**To assume that the t-statistic really follows a t-distribution the following must all be true**
- the sample must be simple random sample
- either the original variable X is normal or $n \geq 30$
- when there are samples from two populations the above must be true for both

### Determining the Critical Value and Sketching the Rejection Region

|english|symbolic|null and alternative|tail region|
|--|--|--|--|
|less than 30% of canadians approve of stronger gun laws|$p<30\%$|$\frac {H_0 p \geq 0.3}{H_1 p \gt 0.3}$| right tailed ($H_1$ is checking to see if it is greater than $H_0$) |
|the mean age of the full time student is 22|$\mu = 22$|$\frac {H_0 p eq 22}{H_1 p \neq 22}$|right and left tails (compares vs greater and less that 22)|
|the mean age of the part time students is atleast 31 | $\mu \geq 31$ |$\frac {H_0 p \geq 31}{H_1 p \lt 31}$|left tailed (anything less than 31 is the alternative hypothosis $H_1$) |
|the mean clay content of building site a is greater than building site b|$\mu \geq 31$|$\frac {H_0 \mu _{A} - \mu _{B} \gt 0}{H_1  \mu _{A} - \mu _{B} \lt 0}$|right tailed (our $H_0$ or null hypothesis is wrong if site b has a **greater** clay content|

$\alpha$ or our significance level determines our shaded area for a rejection region

### writing our final conclusion

the conclusion of a hypothesis must be stated in terms of the original claim the wording depends on
- is the claim the null or alternative hypothesis
- was the null rejected or not

**for null hypotheses claims**

|Decision|reject null|fail to reject null|
|--|--|--|
|Wording|"there is sufficient evidence to reject the claim that.."|"There is insufficient evidence to reject the claim that..."|

**for alternative hypotheses claims**

|Decision|reject null|fail to reject null|
|--|--|--|
|Wording|"there is insufficient evidence to reject the claim that.."|"There is sufficient evidence to reject the claim that..."


### type 1 and type 2 error

ùêª0: The defendant is innocent

ùêª1: The defendant is guilty

we have 4 possible outcomes
1. guilty defendant found guilt 
    - no error
2. guilty defendant found innocent
    - type 2 error wrongly released
3. innocent defendant found innocent
    - no error
4. innocent defendant found guilty
    - Type 1 error wrongly convicted

**type 1 error**
can only occur if the null hypothesis is true. if the sample data leads us to reject $H_0$ even the $H_0$ is true we have commited a type 1 error

the probability for a type 1 error is equivilant to the significance level aka $\alpha$

to reduce type 1 errors either reduce $\alpha$ or the sample size $n$

**type 2 error**
 A Type 2 error can only occur if the null hypothesis ùêª0 is false. If the same data leads us
to fail to reject ùëØùüé even though ùëØùüé is false, then we have committed a Type 2 error.

the probability of this happening is called $\beta$

the formula for $\beta$ is $\beta$ = P(Fail to reject $H_0$ | $H_0$ is False)



## homework question 

25 typists are randomly selected, and the preferred keyboard height is determined for each of them. The
resulting sample average is 64.5 cm and sample standard deviation is 2.5 cm. Suppose that the population of the
preferred heights for all typists is normally distributed. At a significance level of 5%, test the claim that the
population mean of the preferred keyboard height is 66.0 cm (the recommended average keyboard height)

25 typist randomly selected
sample average preffered 64.5 cm keyboard
std if 2.5 cm
suppose preffered height is normally distributed
$\alpha{0.05}$

test the claim that the population mean of the preffered keyboard height is 66.0 cm
